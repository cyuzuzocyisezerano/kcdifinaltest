            <h2>Steps to Achieve Career Success</h2>
            <div class="step">
                <h3>1. Discover Your Passion</h3>
                <p>
                    Your career journey starts with understanding what truly excites and inspires you. At KCDC, we help you identify 
                    your passions, strengths, and values, guiding you toward a career path that aligns with who you are and what you 
                    love to do. Passion is the fuel that drives success.

                <h3>2. Develop Your Skills</h3>
                <p>
                    The key to a successful career is continuous learning and skill development. We offer a wide range of training 
                    programs in various fields, from tailoring and mechanics to digital skills and entrepreneurship. At KCDC, we equip 
                    you with practical skills that open doors to endless opportunities and elevate your career potential.

            </div>
            <div class="step">
                <h3>3. Build Your Network</h3>
                <p>
                    Your network is your net worth. The relationships you build along the way can open new doors and create 
                    opportunities for growth. We encourage you to connect with like-minded individuals, mentors, and industry 
                    leaders who can offer support, advice, and valuable connections on your career journey.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="step">
                <h3>4. Set Clear Goals</h3>
                <p>
                    Success is achieved through focused effort. Set SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound) 
                    goals for your career and work tirelessly toward them. At KCDC, we guide you in setting both short-term and long-term 
                    goals that will give you clarity and direction as you move forward.
                </p>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>5. Embrace Opportunities and Challenges</h3>
                <p>
                    The road to success is not always smooth, but it's the challenges and setbacks that shape us into stronger, more 
                    resilient individuals. At KCDC, we teach you to embrace opportunities and challenges alike, seeing every experience 
                    as a stepping stone toward your ultimate goal.
