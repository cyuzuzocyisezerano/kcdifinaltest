            <h2>Why Youth Empowerment Matters</h2>
            <p>
                At **Koroboza Career Development Center (KCDC)**, we believe in the immense potential of the youth to shape the future. 
                Empowering young people means providing them with the tools, resources, and opportunities they need to succeed. We aim 
                to foster independence, leadership, and self-sufficiency among youth, giving them the confidence to pursue their dreams 
                and contribute meaningfully to society.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Initiatives for Empowering Youth</h2>
            <div class="initiative">
                <h3>Vocational Training</h3>
                <p>
                    We offer a wide range of vocational training programs, including tailoring, carpentry, agriculture, ICT, and more. 
                    These programs equip youth with practical, marketable skills that open doors to stable employment and entrepreneurship. 
                    By focusing on hands-on training, we ensure that young people are well-prepared for the workforce and able to support 
                    themselves and their families.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="initiative">
                <h3>Leadership Development</h3>
                <p>
                    Our leadership programs help youth develop essential skills such as decision-making, communication, and problem-solving. 
                    Through mentorship, group activities, and real-world projects, we empower young individuals to take on leadership roles 
                    in their communities, schools, and workplaces, creating a ripple effect of positive change.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="initiative">
                <h3>Financial Literacy & Entrepreneurship</h3>
                <p>
                    Financial independence is key to empowering youth. Through our entrepreneurship and financial literacy programs, 
                    we provide youth with the knowledge to start their own businesses, manage finances, and invest in their future. 
                    We encourage a mindset of innovation and problem-solving, giving young people the tools to create sustainable businesses 
                    that can contribute to their communities' growth.
                </p>

            <div class="initiative">
                <h3>Mentorship & Guidance</h3>
                <p>
                    Our mentorship programs connect youth with role models and professionals who can offer advice, guidance, and support 
                    as they navigate their career paths. These relationships help foster confidence, provide career direction, and build 
                    a network of support that lasts a lifetime.
